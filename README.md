-Updated index.html to have working crime function.
- Crime function in page script, needs to be added to final .js folder nested in Daland's map api function.
- Need to integrate authentication js file into main file body.
- Need to determine if location history is doable - if not able to be added and resolved with limited effort, I say we axe it.
 
- Think I found a way to make the page look like it transitions between HTML pages. 
    -Place first page Brooke made in "login div" add original background to login div and make it hide when submit button is pushed, this will show Div#2 which is...
    - Place second location search page in "location div". add original background to this div, and when submit, hide div and show the last div.
    - The "data div".  Copy paste the lcoation div search functions (which will work identically beacuse its the same code)- this way, a user can search for a new location as needed.  Add all the rest of the info in here and keep the global style rules. Boom

        - Honestly, all that sounds like way too much work. But thought I'd write it anyway. Bummer we found out about it so late in the game.

- Let's verify we actually hit all of the project requirements originally posted to GitHub.

- Presentation
    - I was thinking we discuss tomorrow how we want to break it up and who has ownership of what section of the PPT.  These are just a few things I have mulled over in my mind and I am just throwing out there to lend some light guidance to what will be a very busy team day.
        
        - Slide topics could be:

            - Explain what we made - one person takes two - three minutes to go through and explain what our app is, how it came to be and the general idea of it.

            - Run through of the site - someone actually goes through and demos two to three locations.  Third location could be crowdsource from other students watching the presentation.

            The top two ones can be managed by two people as someone would need to drie the site whil the other speaks.  they can take turns going back and forth.  I imagine 5 minutes for these.

            - Technology walkthrough - someone talks about the APIs we used, bootstrapj, authentication, and project team management. This one probably requires the most background research to speak to the core technologies that power the site and how and why they work. Approx 3 Minutes

            - Finally, behind the scenes - last unspoken team member goes through the process of developing the app together, the lost names (RIP DB squared), the APIs we applied for and didnt / couldnt use (go f yourself Untappd, BeerMapper, Crimespot), cut features due to inexperience or time constraints, and different ways we changed direction. Approx 3 minutes.

            - Finally, a thank you for watching and reading and a polite reminder - "please dont get stabbed when getting beer. educate yourself.  NFB!"


Whew.  I typed alot. Hope the read was good! (by the way its 10:42 as of completion of this post).
